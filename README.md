This project is the capstone of the Google analytics certificate.

## What is Cyclistic?
Cyclistic is a prominent bike-share company based in Chicago, offering a comprehensive fleet of over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. What sets Cyclistic apart is its commitment to inclusivity, providing not only traditional bikes but also reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to cater to riders with disabilities and those who prefer alternative options

## This Project
In this compelling portfolio project, the dataset provided by Google serves as the foundation for answering a crucial question: How do annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes differently? By exploring and analyzing this data, we can uncover meaningful insights that will inform the creation of targeted marketing strategies.

## The Project Workflow
To complete this project, I followed a structured workflow that leveraged various tools and techniques:
1) Data Cleaning in Excel: Initially, I used Excel to clean the dataset and prepare it for further analysis.
2) Data Loading to SQL: After cleaning the data, I loaded it into a SQL database to conduct the analysis.
3) Analysis and Findings: Using SQL queries, I performed insightful analysis on the dataset, extracting key findings that shed light on the differences between annual members and casual riders.
4) Exporting Results to Excel: To present the findings effectively, I exported the results from SQL back to Excel for data visualization purposes.

## My Findings
1) Member riders account for more rider as compared to casual riders.

2) Riders prefer classic bikes as compared to electric and docked bikes.
